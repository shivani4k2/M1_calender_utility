# High level requirements
| ID  | High level requirements |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| HL1  |Take inputs from user|
| HL2  | Store the data inserted  |
| HL3  | provide the calender for all the 12 months of the required year |
# Low level requirements
| ID  | low level requirements |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| H1L1  |Providing all the available options|
| H2L1  | Initializing database to zero |
| H2L2|Updating the data to the database|
| H3L2|Calculating the calender for the given input|
| H3L1  | print final result to screen |

# Best followed Method
* Instead of using multiple if statements for selection, we use switch case which is the best method to follow and provides the best results.
